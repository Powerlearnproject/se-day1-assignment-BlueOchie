Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintining software
-Reliability-Ensures software performs as expected without bias.
-Efficiency- Helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining quality standard
-Security-Implement protetion practice like authentication to secure users' information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The Birth of Compilers: Before compilers, programmers had to write code in machine language, which was extremely tedious and error-prone
-The Development of the Structured Programming Paradigm: Structured programming introduced a systematic way of writing programs with a clear control flow, making them easier to understand, test, and maintain.
-The Rise of Agile Methodologies: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), revolutionized software development by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Coding-Converting software design into tangible codes
-Design-Building framework
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology- Is linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. There is low flexibility as compared Agile.
-Agile methodology- Is Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles. It has high flexibility.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer- Develops applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks. Maintains software to keep it functional.
-Quality Assuarance Engineer- Collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement. Analyses the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient
-Project Manager- Assembles and lead the software development team. Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-An Intergrated development environment is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software application by providing a space to write,compile,debug code sometimes with value-adding tools to reduce development effortse e.g Visual Studio Code
-IDE compiles and converts the code into a simplified language that the OS can understand
-Version Control Systems(VCS)-Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source codes overtime
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Software security -programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. Solution is research ways to defend against hacking.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit test-are close to the source of an application. It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly.
-Intergration test- Verify that different modules or services used by your appliction work well together. Helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is the art of designing and refining prompts (input queries or instructions) to interact effectively with AI models. Effective prompt engineering ensures that the AI's responses are accurate and relevant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt: "Tell me about computers."
-Improved Prompt: "Can you explain the evolution of personal computers, including key technological advancements and their impact on society from the 1980s to present day?"
-Clarity: The improved prompt clearly specifies what aspect of computers the user is interested inâ€”the evolution of personal computers.
